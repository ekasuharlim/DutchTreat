Setup static files :
app.UseStaticFiles()
Static files must be inside wwwroot

Default static files :
app.UseDefaultFiles()
	Search the file inside wwwroot
	Change the internal path to point to the file
	return the changed internal path

Enable MVC :
	Services.AddControllersWithViews()
	app.UseRouting();
	app.UseEndpoints(Action<IEndPpointBuilder>);

How UseEndPoints works :
	Understanding ASP.NET Core Endpoint Routing https://aregcode.com/blog/2019/dotnetcore-understanding-aspnet-endpoint-routing/
	EndpointRoutingApplicationBuilderExtensions -> extension class that has UseRouting and UseEndpoints method
	UseRouting : to match pattern with url
		UseRouting will call EndpointRoutingMiddleware -> responsible for matching url with pattern specified in UseEndPoints
	UseEndPoints : endpoint mapping and dispatch endpoint
				   mapping defined here also can be accessed in UseRouting when request comes			
				   mapping is defined in this class
				   will call EndpointMiddleware for dispatching
		UseEndPoints : will call EndpointMiddleware
